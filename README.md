### Hi there 👋

#### I am María Morales, Front-End Engineer from Canary Islands, Spain.

- 📚 I am a [**Higher Technician in Development of Web Applications**](https://www.todofp.es/dam/jcr:7c3d42db-83bf-4abb-9d81-cd4f41fe1a1a/n-tsdesarrolloaplicacionesweben-pdf.pdf), but I am also [**Graduated in Spanish Philology**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philology), specialized in Contemporary Literature and focused on [Ramón Gómez de la Serna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ram%C3%B3n_G%C3%B3mez_de_la_Serna).
- ⚙️ I use daily `.vue`, `.ts`, `.json`, `.css`, `.scss`, `.svg`.
- 🌱 I would like to know more about **Web Design**, **Clean Code**, **Digital Gardens** and **Computational Linguistics**.
- 🙋🏼‍♀️ Ping me about **Vue**, **Storybook**, **React**, **CSS**, **JavaScript** and **RAMÓN**.
- 💬 I share interesting stuff about Front-End Development on my channel [Front Stuff](https://t.me/stuff_front) (Telegram).
- ❤️ I love Nintendo, the 80's and the tropical house music. I had to say it.
- ⚡️ Fun fact: I have two pets: [**Null**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_pointer) (cat) and [**Mocha**](https://github.com/doodlewind/mocha1995) (chihuahua).
- 😮 Unexpected fact: I have a small Nokia collection. My top #1 is the model [Nokia 7600](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_7600).
- ❓ *maremarismaria* and The Last Curiosity: my username *maremarismaria* comes from the Latin noun *mare, maris* (neuter gender), which means 'Sea'. In a literal manner, *mare maris maria* means 'the Sea, from the Sea, the Seas'. Poetic, isn't it?
